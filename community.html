		<span>While Scale & Coin is a professional organization, we also have strong traditions that make our community what it is. During the year Scale hosts a variety of social events for members including retreats, dinners, and events with their families to bond. After joining Scale, all members are placed into families, where younger members are given an upperclassman big that will stay with them both throughout at their Duke experience, and afterwards. Scale & Coin also has a variety of spheres which gives members an opportunity to grow closer and get mentorship from older students in field that they are interested in, including tech, banking, private equity, entrepreneurship, and more.</span>
